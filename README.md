**ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Analysis: Stress and Affect Detection**
Analyzed physiological sensor data from the WESAD dataset to detect stress levels using
time series analysis. Extracted ECG signals from multiple subjects, cleaned and processed
the data, and explored patterns in emotional states based on time-dependent signals. 
Techniques like permutation entropy and statistical complexity were applied to quantify 
irregularities in physiological responses for affective computing research.
